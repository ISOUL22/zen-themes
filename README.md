# zen-themes
My personal collection of zen browser themes &amp; tweaks, most of this was not made by me unless stated otherwise.

## Natsumi-Catppuccin
1. Place all files from `natsumi-catppuccin` in your `chrome` folder
2. Enable `browser.tabs.allow_transparent_browser` in `about:config`
3. Restart zen.

This theme changes the interface of zen browser and some default pages, for better consistency across your browsing experience I recommend the [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) extension and the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin?tab=readme-ov-file) repo.
